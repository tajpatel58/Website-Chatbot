# Girlfriend-Chatbot:

### Packages Used: 

- NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) - Pre-Processing/Extracting Features from Messages data.
- Boto3 - Accessing Datasets on AWS. 
- PyTorch - Building Model.
- MLFlow. 

### Project Overview: 

Creating a chatbot for recruiters/employers to interact with on my portfolio wesbite. Plan is to create a chat bot that will be trained on typical questions about me: datapoints are questions and the labels are categories like: "Experience", "Hobbies", "Education" etc. Then when a message comes in, the model/bot will predict which category the message belongs in and formulate a response based on some pre-determined responses for questions in this category.

This project has been cloned from my Girlfriend chatbot repo hence there will be a large overlap in terms of code. This chatbot will be deployed using MLFlow.
